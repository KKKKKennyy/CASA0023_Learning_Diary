### 1.1 Corrections

### 1.1.1. Geometric 

#### Definition

When remote sensing data are collected, *the sensor is not pointing directly down to the ground*; *elevation changes due to the undulations of the terrain*; *changes in the trajectory of the vehicle due to winds*; *and the relative motion of the satellite with respect to the earth* can all lead to image distortion. Correction for such images is **geometric correction**.

#### Solution

* In accurate matching of remote sensing images, more complex nonlinear transformation models may be chosen

* Much like the GIS application of overlaying old maps into modern GIS. Geo-matching process to ensure accuracy and spatial consistency of maps
